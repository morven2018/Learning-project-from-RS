### Transcript of the speech

Hi everyone and welcome to my video, where I’ll share a little about me. I’d hope you won’t have time to get bored during this video. So, my name is Alena, and this is my story about my life journey.

My journey as a programmer has always been taken a wrong turn. Or more precisely, it turned out that way. At school, I participated in and won Olympiads in physics and chemistry while I have been studied in the specialized maths and computer science class. After graduating from the bachelor's degree in the Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, I have continued freelancing, just as I did during my studies. However, the COVID is happening, and I found myself working from home with no opportunity to travel. Then I began to work as a project manager. In this position, I managed external company projects.

There, I wrote technical specifications and cards with new features or bugs and maintenance websites through the admin panel with HTML inserts and update documentation of projects. However, there is never calmly anytime. The company was developing websites for the local Ministry of Economics, among the other things, and at the same time some of the sites, in fact, did not have an administrative panel. But at one point, the information site with support measures had to be updated almost daily. Time had been spent both on writing task of updating and for updating both. The work wasn't difficult, to add, remove or update something according to the pattern, so I suggested to the authorities that I do it by myself. Programmer spent half a day explaining how to upload for the product without errors for me, and I have been able to update the site written in Vue.

Life goes on and the department was closed. I was at a crossroads again.

I eventually was scrolling the habr searching of a detailed road map, I have read an article about the experience of learning a frontend at RS School. There is everything looked too good in the article, so I added it to the saved pages and continued to deal with BootStrap with my own. Several days later, I read this article again and decided to register in RS school.

I joined the community on stage 1. I would not say that this study is too difficult for me. The biggest problem is to analyze all the theoretical material has been provided. It has taken more time than completing practical tasks. I really like doing practical tasks as they help me consolidate my skills perfectly. However, I'm anxious that I can't tell if my code is well-written or poorly written.
Let's speak about my favorite tasks. There are: HTML-Builder and Christmas Shop. In the first task, I enjoyed dealing with asynchrony and its impact on other processes, and the second one is seemed difficult to me at some points at the time of execution. Maybe I should have read theoretical materials before doing practical tasks.

Thank you for watching this video to the end, I'd hope you enjoy it. I'm looking forward to the opportunity to train under your guidance, because my goal is to become a good specialist, which is very difficult without an evaluation of my skills from the outside.
